# 24B1837-Build-your-own-GPT-bot

SOC: Build you own GPT bot <br/>
Our objective was to create a basic chatbot which we can use for various purposes. <br/>
In the first two weeks, we learnt the basics of NLP including important libraries like NLTK and Gensim. We also got an understanding of how any AI tool breaks down words and understands them, vectorially and concepts like stemming, embedding and so on. Then we went on to the basics of coding for simple tools like sentiment analysis using PyTorch in which we also got a brief understanding of RNNs. For our milestone, we also use LSTMs. In the fifth week, we learnt a very important concept, Transformers. We covered their basic architecture and implementation using Hugging face. For our milestone we used BERT.<br/>
By the end of fifth week, we got a basic idea of how the overall flow of NLP works. In the sixth week, we learnt how to use Gemini API. We first covered how to get efficient results using AI tools like ChatGPT, this concept is termed as Prompt Engineering. Then we used ChatGPT to learn how to use Gemini API, how to call it and verify in Postman and finally how to use it in python. After this, we came to the concept of RAG, what it is about, and how to implement it. In the final week, we learnt about two applications- BotPress and Ollama. Botpress provides a platform to build and run AI agents for various purposes. We learnt how to make a workflow in Botpress and make a Chatbot for various constitutional rules and regulations. Ollama is a language model that is used to make Chatbots that run offline. We can also use it with a docker to make a desirable interface.  <br/>
